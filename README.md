# liberated
A minecraft datapack for shared singleplayer 'chainworlds'.

The datapack creates unique player profiles, so although player data is technically shared across the world, you are 'liberated' from this issue. 

# instructions

In order to maintain your profile, every time before logging out type: `/trigger chain.log set 1`

You will be frozen and in spectator. From then, you will log out. Either log back in to continue playing or zip the world up as needed to send to whoever you're chaining with.

Uninstall with `/trigger chain.uninstall set 1`

## dependencies

This datapack relies on [phi.core](https://github.com/MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules/tree/master/phi.core/src) and the [phi.modifyinv](https://github.com/MinecraftPhi/MinecraftPhi-modules/tree/master/phi.modifyinv/src) module

MAKE SURE TO HAVE THESE IN YOUR DATAPACK FOLDER OR ENDERCHESTS AND INVENTORY WILL NOT WORK
